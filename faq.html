      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      
      <h2>What is EOS network and how can I use it?</h2>
      <p>
	EOS is a blockchain-based, open source decentralized system that enables the development, hosting, and execution of commercial-scale decentralized applications (dApps) on its platform. You can find more information at <a href="https://www.eos.io/">eos.io</a> website.
      </p>
      
      <h2>What is EOS token and how I can get it?</h2>
      <p>
	The EOS token is the cryptocurrency of the EOS network. The easiest way to purchase EOS is through an exchange. Bitfinex is the simplest and most popular option, although there are many others, such as Huobi and Binance.
      </p>
	
      <h2>What is the GoalBarBetting Club ?</h2>
      <p>
	The GoalBarBetting Club is just our first step of our EOS development roadmap. It represents the first of a series of cryptocurrency betting applications. We plan to charge a small fee ranging up to 12%  and the remaining amount is allocated to the winners or sent back to all users if there are no winners. In the future, we plan to create a separate EOS token to be used by the autonomous community (DAC). Check out our <a href="roadmap.html">roadmap</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Why would you join GoalBarBetting Club?</h2>
      <p>
	Most of betting sites are centralized solutions that can be exploited and require that the users have trust on the site running the service. Blockchain will be a game changer in this field. GoalBarBetting is a distributed app running on the EOS crypto network. It preserves your privacy while giving you full transparency about the rules, the wagers and the winning calculations of each game. As our games are 100% smart contract based, you can be confident that each match is verifiably fair and all the calculations are public. See the contract source at our <a href="https://github.com/goalbarclub">GitHub</a>.
	</p>

      <h2>What do I need to use any of the GoalBarBetting dApp?</h2>
      <p>
	At this point, all you need is have the “scatter” wallet configured in your browser. We are developing mobile applications for Android and iPhone (IOs). Also, we are working on integrations with exchanges and other wallets. Check our <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/E1WIN055V3zCYoxdhNC86Q">Telegram channel</a> for finding more information about new partners.
      </p>

      <h2>Why GoalBarBetting dApp charges a fee?</h2>
      <p>
	Our fees are used to cover operational costs, including developers, designers and also to buy EOS RAM/CPU. As we acquire more EOS resources, our system will support more users and grow our user base.
      </p>

      <h2>Is there an Oracle that provides the result of the games?</h2>
      <p>
	Included in the operating costs are the efforts to create automated and semi-automated ways to update the “Oracle” with the results of each game.
      </p>

      <h2>Who chooses the games available for betting?</h2>
      <p>
	The goalbarclub team will initially select games based on their importance on international championships. We are always looking for suggestions about new games. Check out our website for more details.
      </p>

      <h2>Can I promote a game with different rules using GoalBarBetting dApp?</h2>
      <p>
	Not at this moment. This item is the third step on our roadmap on September/18. The most active users will be able to promote their games, involve their friends and change betting parameters.
      </p>

      <h2>Is the GoalBarBetting dApp released under open-source software license?</h2>
      <p>
	Yes, the Eos.place team releases the all GoalBarBetting dapp source code under the MIT software license. The release includes smart contract code and web application codebase.
      </p>
