      <h1>Our Approach</h1><br>
      
      <h2>Blockchain adoption challenge</h2><br>
      
      <p>
	We think that there are three main issues holding Blockchain back from large scale adoption:
      </p>
      <li>
   
	The first obstacle for the technology is the fact that explaining the value blockchain technology is not an easy task. Moreover, the people that are interpreting the details of what’s happening in these industries are not marketers, but cryptographers who are not skilled in introducing innovations to the masses. Consequently, if users can’t understand the value, they won’t buy in.  Additionally, there are many challenges with wallet usability and security.
      </p>
    </li>
        <li>
	The second obstacle relates to how the underlying technology will scale to support mass adoption. At this point, most of the blockchain applications announced are some variation of permission ledgers. This type of blockchain system is very similar to a database. There is no particular advantage if every company or every industry has their permission ledger. The public ledger system that was available so far (Ethereum) has a high operating cost and doesn't scale to sustain any realistic application.
      
 </li>
      <p><li>
	The last obstacle relates to system decentralization. With decentralization, there will be much more transparency, a balance of power and justice. It turns out that the vast majority of centralized solutions address well the problems they attempt to solve. Also, most users have a "good-enough" solution and will not try to find alternatives using non-traditional approaches.
    </li>

      <p><br>
	Consequently,  Blockchain based applications need to demonstrate their real advantages to incentivize users to adopt them. Finally, network effect forces will influence how fast the adoption will reach a critical mass in each of these areas.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	We at EOS.place, acknowledge these issues and believe that a well-designed Blockchain project requires more business modeling than technology development.  In fact, we try to use 70% of the resources for designing a sustainable business model and use the remaining 30% for software engineering.
      </p>
​
      <h2>The EOS platform solution</h2><br>

      <p>
	The EOS platform provides an opportunity for developers to deliver value using a blockchain technology that is performant and scalable. Also, we've found that the high level of maturity and flexibility provided by the EOS governance mechanisms can nurture innovation of the platform while allowing developers to solve real problems.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the end, reality always wins, and the actual value of the EOS project will be driven by how Decentralized Autonomous Community (DAC) systems can solve significant problems for existing users.
      </p>
​

      <h2>Our approach</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
	In our first initiative, we sought to develop several applications on the same domain with increased levels of complexity. This approach allows us to master techniques at each stage and continue to leverage the lessons learned from previous apps in the next versions of the Dapp. It also permitted us to realize gradual results, reassess design decisions and take corrective actions.
